# Email & Password Authentication

The project comes with support for basic Email & Password authentication. Configuration is setup the same as the JavaScript Web SDK.

## Configuration

This guide assumes that you have already created your Firebase app and configured your iOS and Android projects as explained in [README](README.md).

On the Firebase console, select your project. Under the "Develop" section on the sidebar, select "Authentication". Along the tabs, select "Sign-in method".

Edit the "Email/Password" row & enable the provider:

![enable email password](/docs/assets/firebase-email-password.png)

Click the save button. Your project is now setup and can use Email/Password sign in!
